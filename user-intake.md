# Client Intake Form for Dog Walking and Sitting Services Platform

## General Business Information
1. **Business Overview**
   - Can you provide an overview of your dog walking and sitting services? I'll email you something for the About page but you know me. 
   - What motivates you to run this business, and what are your primary goals? Ha, I love dogs! Again I'll email it you. 

2. **Target Audience**
   - Who are your primary customers (e.g., working professionals, elderly pet owners)? 9-5 workers. But this is a tough one really.
   I would say I have quite a lot of enquiries, often word of mouth, from new potential customer who wants to research my services. I want them to have a good idea of what I do/offer before they call/email me with loads of questions. Then there are clients who want to book the initial meet&greet so they can come on boards. If they can see my schedule and book that that would be great, but they can't book walks till I've agreed them. I won't walk dogs I believe won't suit me and my pack! Then I have about ten regular clients at the moment. They email, message, call to book things it's a bit of a nightmare, I want them to be able to book things, cancel and change their own bookings so I'm not online for two hours a night sorting shit out. 
   - Are there specific geographic areas you serve? – West and Central Bristol for walking. Surrounding areas for pet-sitting. But I can be really flexible. 

3. **Pricing Structure**
   - How do you charge for your services (e.g., hourly, flat fee per session)? From £15 for walking; from £30 per night for sitting. Other services depend on the details of the pet, time etc. So I'd like to be able to take money for a bespoke package online. 
   - Do you offer packages or discounts for recurring bookings? No. I don't need to discount.

   - Are there restrictions based on dog size, breed, or behavior? I always have my own two dogs with me, so they'd have to get on with them. Otherwise I will decide that on meeting the dog (and owner). I won't do it if we are not a good fit.
