            <p>I have always loved animals, and studied and worked as a wildlife filmographer. I have worked for the BBC's Natural History unit, including spending time in Africa filming environmental documentaries. </p>
            <p>When I finished my MA in Film Studies at Bristol University, I decided to train as a dog walker to use my skills and indulge my love of dogs, while still freelancing in film and editing. </p>
            <p>Dog care has become my full-time job; way beyond financial rewards, this career offers me flexibility, independence and the joy of working with animals every day.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for a trustworthy, qualified, and passionate dog walker or pet sitter, I’m here to help. Let’s work together to ensure your pets get the care and attention they deserve.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions at all, please do get in touch!</p>
